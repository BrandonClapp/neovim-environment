Things to figure out:

#### Q. How do I get find all to work?

Telescope does this. It requires ripgrep to work. :checkhealth will tell you that you need to install that for the find feature to work.

This can be installed with `brew install ripgrep`

#### Q. How to create a new file:

Inside of nvim tree, press `a`

#### Q. How do I get icons working instead of displaying question mark boxes? [?]
